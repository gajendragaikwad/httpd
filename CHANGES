Changes with Apache 2.5.1

  *) mod_userdir: If several directories are given in a UserDir directive, only files
     in the first existing one are checked. If the file is not found there, the
     other possible directories are not checked. The doc clearly states that they
     will be checked one by one, until a match is found or an external redirect is
     performed.  PR 59636.
     [Christophe Jaillet]

  *) mod_proxy: Fix a corner case where the ProxyPassReverseCookieDomain or
     ProxyPassReverseCookiePath directive could fail to update correctly 
     'domain=' or 'path=' in the 'Set-Cookie' header.  PR 61560.
     [Christophe Jaillet]

  *) mod_slotmem_shm: Add generation number to shm filename to fix races
     with graceful restarts. PRs 62044 and 62308.  [Jim Jagielski, Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_rewrite: Only create the global mutex used by "RewriteMap prg:" when
     this type of map is present in the configuration.  PR62311.  
     [Hank Ibell <hwibell gmail.com>]

  *) mod_ldap: Abort on LDAP locking errors. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_ssl: Support loading certificates and private keys from the
     PKCS#11 OpenSSL engine.  [Anderson Sasaki <ansasaki redhat.com>,
     Joe Orton]

  *) mod_proxy_html: Fix variable interpolation and memory allocation failure
     in ProxyHTMLURLMap.  [Ewald Dieterich <ewald mailbox.org>]

  *) core: In ONE_PROCESS/debug mode, cleanup everything when exiting.
     [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_http2: restoring the v1.10.16 keepalive timeout behavioud of mod_http2 (to be verified).
     [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_http2: adding an abort function to slave connections' pools, so out-of-memory
     events lead to a control process abort, as on HTTP/1.x connections. [Stefan Eissing]
  
  *) mod_http2: adding regular memory cleanup when transferring large response bodies. This
     reduces memory footprint and avoids memory exhaustion when transferring large files
     on 32-bit architectures. Fixes PR 62325. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) http: LimitRequestBody applies to proxied requests.  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_proxy_http: Fix response header thrown away after the previous one
     was considered too large and truncated. PR 62196. [Yann Ylavic]

  *) core: Add and handle AP_GETLINE_NOSPC_EOL flag for ap_getline() family
     of functions to consume the end of line when the buffer is exhausted.
     PR 62198. [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_xml2enc: Fix forwarding of error metadata/responses. PR 62180.
     [Micha Lenk <micha lenk.info>, Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_proxy_http: Add new worker parameter 'responsefieldsize' to
     allow maximum HTTP response header size to be increased past 8192 
     bytes.  PR62199.  [Hank Ibell <hwibell gmail.com>]

  *) core: Preserve the original HTTP request method in the '%<m' LogFormat
     when an path-based ErrorDocument is used.  PR 62186. 
     [Micha Lenk <micha lenk.info>]

  *) mod_proxy_balancer: Add hot spare member type and corresponding flag (R). Hot spare members are
     used as drop-in replacements for unusable workers in the same load balancer set. This differs
     from hot standbys which are only used when all workers in a set are unusable. PR 61140. [Jim
     Riggs]

  *) mod_logio: Add LogIOTrackTTFU and %^FU logformat to log the time
     difference between request start and last request body byte read (finished upload).
     [Rainer Jung]

  *) mod_ssl: add support for TLSv1.3 (tested with OpenSSL v1.1.1-pre4, other libs may
     need more sugar). SSL(Proxy)CipherSuite now has an optional first parameter for the
     protocol the ciphers are for.
     Directive "SSLVerifyClient" now triggers certificate retrieval from the client (this
     is not fully tested - but fails in similar fashion as in TLSv1.2 in my setups).
     Verifying the client fails exactly the same for HTTP/2 connections for all SSL protocols,
     as this would need to trigger the master connection thread - which we do not support
     right now.
     Renegotiation of ciphers is intentionally ignored for TLSv1.3 connections. "SSLCipherSuite"
     does not allow to specify TLSv1.3 ciphers in a directory context (because it cannot work) and
     TLSv1.2 or lower ciphers are not relevant, as cipher suites are completely separate.
     This means there is a bit if a world split when simultaneously having TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3
     connections to the same server.
     [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_http2: accurate reporting of h2 data input/output per request via mod_logio. Fixes
     an issue where output sizes where counted n-times on reused slave connections. See
     gituhub issue: https://github.com/icing/mod_h2/issues/158
     [Stefan Eissing]
  
  *) mod_proxy: Do not restrict the maximum pool size for backend connections
     any longer by the maximum number of threads per process and use a better
     default if mod_http2 is loaded.
     [Yann Ylavic, Ruediger Pluem, Stefan Eissing, Gregg Smith]

  *) mod_ssl: Fix merging of proxy SSL context outside <Proxy> sections,
     regression introduced in 2.4.30. PR 62232. [Rainer Jung, Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_ssl: proper checks for libressl 2.07/8 and its TLSv1_3 support, see PR 62236.
     [Bernard Spil <brnrd@freebsd.org>]
  
  *) mod_http2: on level trace2, log any unsuccessful HTTP/2 direct connection upgrade
     with base64 encoding to unify its appearance in possible bug reports. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_cgi: Add CGIScriptTimeout to make mod_cgi's timeout per-directory and
     independent of the core Timeout directive.  PR 62229.  
     [Hank Ibell <hwibell gmail.com>]

  *) mod_remoteip: Restore compatibility with APR 1.4 (apr_sockaddr_is_wildcard).
     [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_ssl: heavily simplified SSLPolicy. No more user defines, no propxy policies,
     just the basic "modern", "intermediate" and "old" as specified by Mozilla security.
     [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_remoteip: make proxy-protocol work on slave connections, e.g. in HTTP/2
     requests. See also https://github.com/roadrunner2/mod-proxy-protocol/issues/6
     [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_md: fixes error in renew window calculation that may lead to mod_md running
     watchdog in a tight loop until actual renewal becomes necessary. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_md: /.well-known/acme-challenge requests that cannot be answered for hostnames
     outside the configured MDs are free to be answered by other handlers. This allows
     co-existance between mod_md and other ACME clients on the same server (implements PR62189).
     [Stefan Eissing, Arkadiusz Miskiewicz <arekm@maven.pl>]

  *) mod_md: Fix compilation with OpenSSL before version 1.0.2.  [Rainer Jung]

  *) core: Create a conn_config_t structure to hold an extendable core config rather
     than consuming the whole pointer with the connection socket. [Graham Leggett]

  *) core: adding AP_DECLARE for ap_parse_vhost_addrs() and minor bumb mmn. Resolves
     building mod_ssl on Windows. [Stefan Eissing, Gregg Smith]

  *) mod_http2: discourage gzip/brotli content encoding on http2-status responses as
     they are inserted into the reponse when filters are already done. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) core: adding defines to allow interworking with honggfuzz without
     further patches. [Stefan Eissing, Robert Swiecki]

  *) mod_headers: 'RequestHeader set|edit|edit_r Content-Type X' could 
     inadvertently modify the Content-Type _response_ header. Applies to
     Content-Type only and likely to only affect static file responses.
     [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_cgi: Improve AH01215 messages to make it more clear that the message is
     the CGI scripts stderr output. PR 61980. [Hank Ibell <hwibell gmail.com>]

  *) mod_headers: Allow 'Header unset Content-Type' to remove the Content-Type
     header. PR 61983. [Hank Ibell <hwibell gmail.com>]

  *) mod_md v1.1.8: new configuration directive "MDBaseServer on|off" to allow/inhibit 
     management of the base server domains outside VirtualHosts. By default, this is "off", 
     e.g. mod_md will not manage certificates or perform https: redirections on the 
     base server. [Stefan Eissing]
              
  *) core: Add "AcceptErrorsNonFatal" to allow ECONNREFUSED, ECONNABORTED, and
     ECONNRESET during the client accept() to not trigger graceful shutdown of
     the child process.  [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_md v1.1.7:
     - MDMustStaple was unable to create the necessary OpenSSL OBJ identifier on some platforms, 
       possibly because this fails if the OID is already configured in ```openssl.cnf```, see
       [here](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/2795).
     - Two memory leaks in cert issuer and alt-names lookup eliminated by Yann Ylavic.
     - Changing MDMustStaple triggers certificate renewal.
     - More verbosity when *not* handing out certificates, e.g. mod_ssl asks, but mod_md has no
       idea what it is talking about. Some people report misbehaviour here.
     - Re-enabled support for md_get_credentials() function that was used in older mod_ssl
       patch, so that people with old patched servers get a chance to upgrade.
     [Stefan Eissing, Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_susbtitute: Allow expressions in the subtitution, prefixed with expr=
     [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_md: fixed mem pool usage for auto-added server names. Added
     error logging of exact ACME response when challenges failed.
     [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_dumpio: do nothing below log level TRACE7.  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_md: reverses most of v1.0.5 optimization of post_config init, so that
     mod_ssl can ask for certiticates without crashing. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_proxy: allow SSLProxyCheckPeer* usage for all proxy modules.
     PR 61857.  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_proxy_html: fix handling of <meta http-equiv> elements.
     PR 58121.  [Nick Kew]

  *) mod_md: fixed backward compatibility to old <ManagedDomain configuration.
     Add higher level WARNING log when initial request to ACME server fails, mentioning
     some advice. [Stefan Eissing] 
     
  *) mod_md: name change in configuration directives. The old names are still working
     in this version, so you can safely upgrade. They will give warnings in the log and
     will disappear in the immediate future. ManagedDomain is now MDomain,
     <ManagedDomain> is now <MDomainSet>. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_ssl: renamed section <SSLPolicy to <SSLPolicyDefine. Fixed behaviour
     for new server config merge flag. Denying global, only once used directives
     inside a SSLPolicyDefine. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_auth_basic: Be less tolerant when parsing the credencial. Only spaces
     should be accepted after the authorization scheme. \t are also tolerated.
     [Christophe Jaillet]
  
  *) mod_http2: fixed unfair scheduling when number of active connections
     exceeded the scheduling fifo capacity. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) core: Support zone/scope in IPv6 link-local addresses in Listen and
     VirtualHost directives (requires APR 1.7.x or later).  PR 59396.  [Joe Orton]

  *) mod_md: v1.0.5, restricting post_config dry run to be more silent and performing
     only necessary work for mod_ssl to be also happy with the configuration.
     [Stefan Eissing] 

  *) mod_md: v1.0.4, removed the 'a2md' utility command from build. Only used in github
     testing. Avoid problems with our build system that had problems after the latest
     changes to make a clean initial build. Remove the windows a2md.dsp therefore also.
     [Stefan Eissing] 

  *) mod_ssl: Fail with 403 if the username for FakeBasicAuth mode
     includes a colon character.  PR 52644.  [Joe Orton]

  *) mod_md: v1.0.3, fixed various bugs in persisting job properties, so that status is 
     persisted accross child process changes and staging is reset on reloads. Changed 
     MDCertificateAgreement url checks. As long as the CA reports that the account has 
     an agreement, no further checking is done. Existing accounts need no changes when
     a new agreement comes out. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_watchdog: Correct some log messages.  [Rainer Jung]

  *) mod_noloris: complete build setup.  [Rainer Jung]

  *) mod_md: fix static compilation.  [Rainer Jung]

  *) mod_md: fix compilation of helper binary a2md.  [Rainer Jung]

  *) core: fix pcre feature detection in configure when using pcre2.  [Rainer Jung]

Changes with Apache 2.5.0-alpha

  *) mod_md: v1.0.1, ServerName/Alias names from pure-http: virtual hosts are no longer
     auto-added to a Managed Domain. Error counts of jobs are presisted. When the server
     restarts (gracefully) any errored staging areas are purged to reset the signup/renewal
     process. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_md: v1.0.0, new config directive 'MDNotifyCmd' to hook in a program when Managed
     Domains have obtained/renewed their certificates successfully. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_md: v0.9.9, fix for applying challenge type based on available ports. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_md: v0.9.7
     - Use of the new module flag
     - Removed obsolete function from interface to mod_ssl. 
     - Fallback certificates has version set and no longer claims to be a CA. (re issue #32)
     - MDRequireHttps now happens before any Redirect.
     [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_ssl: unshare SSLSrvConfigRec instances between base server and virtual hosts. This avoids
     overwrites of later initializattions (vhost_id), selective disables by "SSLEngine addr-list"
     and certificate/key pickup from mod_md. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_md: v0.9.6: a "MDRequireHttps permament" configured domain automatically sends out
     HSTS (rfc 6797) headers in https: responses. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_ssl: adding ssl_policies.h[.in] for policy cipher/protocol definitions. Use 
     update_policies.py to update manually from Mozilla JSON definitions at
     https://statics.tls.security.mozilla.org/server-side-tls-conf.json
     [Stefan Eissing]
     
  *) mod_md: v0.9.5:
     - New directive (srly: what do you expect at this point?) "MDMustStaple on|off" to control if
       new certificates are requested with the OCSP Must Staple extension.
     - Known limitation: when the server is configured to ditch and restart child processes, for example
       after a certain number of connections/requests, the mod_md watchdog instance might migrate 
       to a new child process. Since not all its state is persisted, some messsages might appear a
       second time in the logs.
     - Adding checks when 'MDRequireHttps' is used. It is considered an error when 'MDPortMap 443:-'
       is used - which negates that a https: port exists. Also, a warning is logged if no 
       VirtualHost can be found for a Managed Domain that has port 443 (or the mapped one) in
       its address list.
     - New directive 'MDRequireHttps' for redirecting http: traffic to a Managed Domain, permanently
       or temporarily.
     - Fix for using a fallback certificate on initial signup of a Managed Domain. Requires also
       a changed mod_ssl patch (v5) to take effect.
     - compatibility with libressl
       [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_md: v0.9.2: new directive 'MDHttpProxy' to define a proxy for outgoing connection,
     some minor bugfixes, twiddle the build system to avoid non-pic code generation.
     [Stefan Eissing]
  
  *) mod_md: v0.9.1:
     - various fixes in MDRenewWindow handling when specifying percent. Serialization changed. If 
       someone already used percent configurations, it is advised to change these to a new value,
       reload and change back to the wanted ones.
     - various fixes in handling of MDPrivateKeys when specifying 2048 bits (the default) explicitly.
     - mod_md version removed from top level md_store.json file. The store has its own format version
       to facilitate upgrades.
    [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_md: v0.9.0:
     Certificate provisioning from Let's Encrypt (and other ACME CAs) for mod_ssl virtual hosts.
     [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_ssl: add SSLPolicy (define/use) and SSLProxyPolicy directives plus documentation. Add
     core definitions for policies 'modern', 'intermediate' and 'old', as defined by Mozilla
     in <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS>. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_md: new module for managing domains across VirtualHosts with ACME protocol 
     implementation for automated certificate signup and renewal. Default CA is
     the test area of Let's Encrypt right now, so certificates root will not be valid.
     Will be switched to the real service endpoint rather soon. If you need it now,
     configure 'MDCertificateAuthority https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory'.
     [Stefan Eissing] 

  *) mod_rewrite: Add 'RewriteOptions LongURLOptimization' to free memory
     from each set of unmatched rewrite conditions.
     [Eric Covener]

  *) Allow the argument to <IfFile>, <IfDefine>, <IfSection>, <IfDirective>, 
     and <IfModule> to be quoted.  This is primarily for the benefit of
     <IfFile>. [Eric Covener]

  *) Introduce request taint checking framework to prevent privilege
     hijacking through .htaccess. [Nick Kew]

  *) Add <IfDirective> and <IfSection> directives.  [Joe Orton]

  *) When using mod_status with the Event MPM, report the number of requests
     associated with an active connection in the "ACC" field. Previously
     zero was always reported with this MPM.  PR60647. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_remoteip: When overriding the useragent address from X-Forwarded-For,
     zero out what had been initialized as the connection-level port.  PR59931.
     [Hank Ibell <hwibell gmail.com>]

  *) mod_proxy_wstunnel: Reliably run before mod_proxy_http.
     [Eric Covener]

  *) http: Allow unknown response status' lines returned in the form of
     "HTTP/x.x xxx Status xxx".  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) core: Add <IfFile> configuration section to allow any file on disk to be
     used as a conditional.  [Edward Lu, Eric Covener]

  *) mod_crypto: Add the all purpose crypto filters with support for HLS.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) core: Drop an invalid Last-Modified header value coming
     from a FCGI/CGI script instead of replacing it with Unix epoch.
     Warn the users about Last-Modified header value replacements
     and violations of the RFC.
     [Yann Ylavic, Luca Toscano, William Rowe, Jacob Champion]

  *) mod_dav: Allow other modules to become providers and add ACLs
     to the DAV response.
     [Jari Urpalainen <jari.urpalainen nokia.com>, Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_dav: Add dav_begin_multistatus, dav_send_one_response,
     dav_finish_multistatus, dav_send_multistatus, dav_handle_err,
     dav_failed_proppatch, dav_success_proppatch to mod_dav.h.
     [Jari Urpalainen <jari.urpalainen nokia.com>, Graham Leggett]

  *) core: explicitly exclude 'h2' from protocols announced via an Upgrade: 
     header as commanded by http-wg. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_proxy_ajp: Add "secret" parameter to proxy workers to implement legacy
     AJP13 authentication.  PR 53098.  [Dmitry A. Bakshaev <dab1818 gmail com>]

  *) mpm: Generalise the ap_mpm_register_socket functions to accept pipes
     or sockets. [Graham Leggett]

  *) core: Extend support for setting aside data from the network input filter
     to any connection or request input filter. [Graham Leggett]

  *) core: Split ap_create_request() from ap_read_request(). [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_auth_digest: Fix compatibility with expression-based Authname. PR59039.
     [Eric Covener]

  *) mpm: Add a complete_connection hook that confirms whether an MPM is allowed
     to leave the WRITE_COMPLETION phase. Move filter code out of the MPMs.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_cache: Consider Cache-Control: s-maxage in expiration
     calculations.  [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_cache: Allow caching of responses with an Expires header
     in the past that also has Cache-Control: max-age or s-maxage.
     PR55156. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_session: Introduce SessionExpiryUpdateInterval which allows to
     configure the session/cookie expiry's update interval. PR 57300.
     [Paul Spangler <paul.spangler ni.com>]

  *) core: Extend support for asynchronous write completion from the
     network filter to any connection or request filter. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_auth_digest: remove AuthDigestEnableQueryStringHack which is no
     more documented since dec 2012 (r1415960). [Christophe Jaillet]

  *) mod_charset_lite: On EBCDIC platforms, make sure mod_charset_lite runs
     after other resource-level filters. [Eric Covener]

  *) http: Don't remove the Content-Length of zero from a HEAD response if
     it comes from an origin server, module or script.  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) http: Add support for RFC2324/RFC7168. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_authn_core: Add expression support to AuthName and AuthType.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) suexec: Filter out the HTTP_PROXY environment variable because it is
     treated as alias for http_proxy by some programs. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_proxy_http: Don't establish or reuse a backend connection before pre-
     fetching the request body, so to minimize the delay between it is supposed
     to be alive and the first bytes sent: this is a best effort to prevent the
     backend from closing because of idle or keepalive timeout in the meantime.
     Also, handle a new "proxy-flushall" environment variable which allows to
     flush any forwarded body data immediately. PR 56541+37920. [Yann Ylavic]

  *) core: Define and UnDefine are no longer permitted in
     directory context. Previously they would always be evaulated
     as the configuration was read without regard for the directory
     context. [Eric Covener]

  *) config: For directives that do not expect any arguments, enforce
     that none are specified in the configuration file. 
     [Joachim Zobel <jzobel heute-morgen.de>, Eric Covener]

     [Daniel Gruno]

  *) mod_authnz_ldap: Resolve crashes with LDAP authz and non-LDAP authn since 
     r1608202. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_proxy: Now allow for 191 character worker names, with non-fatal
     errors if name is truncated. PR53218. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) mod_ssl: Add optional function "ssl_get_tls_cb" to allow support
     for channel bindings.  [Simo Sorce <simo redhat.com>]

     processing mode. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_authnz_ldap: Fail explicitly when the filter is too long. Remove
     unnecessary apr_pstrdup() and strlen(). [Graham Leggett]

  *) Add the ldap-search option to mod_authnz_ldap, allowing authorization
     to be based on arbitrary expressions that do not include the username.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) Add the ldap function to the expression API, allowing LDAP filters and
     distinguished names based on expressions to be escaped correctly to
     guard against LDAP injection. [Graham Leggett]

  *) Add module mod_ssl_ct, which provides an implementation of Certificate
     Transparency (RFC 6962) for httpd.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_proxy_wstunnel: Avoid sending error responses down an upgraded
     websockets connection as it is being close down. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_proxy_wstunnel: Allow the administrator to cap the amount
     of time a synchronous websockets connection stays idle with 
     ProxyWebsocketIdleTimeout. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_proxy_wstunnel: Change to opt-in for asynchronous support, adding 
     directives ProxyWebsocketAsync and ProxyWebsocketAsyncDelay. 
     [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_proxy_wstunnel: Stop leaking websockets backend connections under
     event MPM (trunk-only). [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_proxy_http: Add detach_backend hook (potentially usable
     in other proxy scheme handlers).  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_deflate: Add DeflateAlterETag to control how the ETag
     is modified. The 'NoChange' parameter mimics 2.2.x behavior.

     redirects to "rewrite-redirect-handler" from "redirect-handler" so
     it is less ambiguous and less likely to be reused. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_rewrite: Protect against looping with the [N] flag by enforcing a 
     default limit of 10000 iterations, and allowing each rule to change its

     setuid/setgid capability bits rather than a setuid root binary.
     [Joe Orton]

     to a file; configure --without-suexec-logfile --with-suexec-syslog.
